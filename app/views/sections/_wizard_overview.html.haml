%p
  GetIdeated was created to help you quickly focus the millions of thoughts 
  you have about your idea.  The next five screens will guide you 
  through creating your...
%ul.round-list
  - @sections.each do |section|
    %li= section.name

  \...with examples and descriptions for each section.  Don't worry if your 
  thoughts are half-baked, we save every version you create so just get your 
  thoughts down now and revisit later.

  You can also easily add any custom sections you might want to have the team 
  focus on as well, such as a SWOT analysis, business names, etc.  Just click 
  + Add Section on the left to create your own sections.

  And finally, use GetIdeated as a virtual whiteboard, sharing the idea with 
  others, posting comments and discussing the fine points of each section.
